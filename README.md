# Decentralised Staking

This is a version of the scaffold-eth quest, built around forge-rs and foundry as opposed to hardhat.
This has now turned into a more complete tool to interact with smart-contracts onchain that I will look to spin off soon.
I will still be attempting to re-do these buidlguidl quests as well though.
